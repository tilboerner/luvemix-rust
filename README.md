# luvemix

A processor emulator for fun and learning Rust.

## "luvemix"?

It's a fun permutation of "emu" and "lxvi", which is latin for 66, which is
short for `0x1966`, which of course means 6502. And of course, figuring out
how to write a CPU emulator and how to program in Rust is a match made in 
heaven.
